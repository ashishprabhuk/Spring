# Coupling
**Coupling** refers to the degree of direct dependence between two components or systems. 
It indicates how much work is involved in changing something. 

There are two types of coupling:
1. **Tight Coupling**
2. **Loose Coupling**

## Examples

### Tight Coupling
A car engine is tightly coupled to the car. (Dependent)  
i.e., If we change the car engine, we need to change the overall car system to adapt to the new engine.

### Loose Coupling
A car wheel is loosely coupled to the car. (Independent)  
i.e., Even if we change the wheels, it won't affect the car's system.

## Benefits of Loose Coupling

- **Flexibility**: Easy to change the implementation of one module without affecting others.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update parts of the code.
- **Reusability**: Modules can be reused in different contexts without modification.
- **Testability**: Easier to test individual components in isolation.
